Why you should stop worrying about being lazy
Originally published on JOTFORM.COM
Bill Gates said it best: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll always hire a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.‚Äù

You hear a lot about how tirelessly software founders work. Most major companies retell stories of how in the early days their founder stayed up all night to build products, create pitch decks, and strategize. You hear about how they rose to the top by sheer will and work ethic.

Not me.

In fact, I might be one of the laziest founders in all of Silicon Valley. I don‚Äôt want to spend all night working. I don‚Äôt want my employees to either. And it‚Äôs a philosophy I developed before I became an entrepreneur 12 years ago.

Prior to founding JotForm, I was a programmer for a media company in New York. That‚Äôs where I learned that good lazy programmers work smart and find solutions to complex problems. They get rid of unnecessary parts and repetition.

I want to change the conversation around what it means to be lazy in the first place.

We unfairly blame laziness for obesity, unemployment, depression, and underperforming students. Then we laugh at it when it manifests as Homer Simpson or Garfield the cat.

But really, laziness is just someone not doing what they don‚Äôt want to do. And what‚Äôs so wrong about that?

When I first started JotForm, I had few opportunities to be lazy. I was motivated to succeed. Even my least favorite tasks excited me because I was working toward a goal of building JotForm. But most importantly, I couldn‚Äôt afford to be lazy.

Today, laziness is about not doing the things I don‚Äôt want to do. And the things I don‚Äôt want to do are usually the things I‚Äôm not suited to do, like accounting, hiring, and design.

In the early days, I had no choice but to do all these things. But I listened to myself as the company grew. The more I dragged my feet about certain tasks and projects, the more I knew those were the roles I needed to hire for.

You‚Äôve heard plenty before about how bad laziness is. So here are six reasons that being sluggish around the office isn‚Äôt so bad.

Six positive outcomes from laziness
Improved efficiency

Some of the world‚Äôs greatest tech spawned because of someone‚Äôs desire to not keep doing things the hard way.

Nowadays you can grocery shop, find a romantic partner, apply for a job, book a trip, or order food without leaving the couch, opening your laptop, or making a call. It‚Äôs a whole economy thriving on laziness‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich is another way of saying it‚Äôs simply become more efficient.

The first of Larry Wall‚Äôs Three Virtues for programmers is laziness, ‚Äúthe quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure.‚Äù

I‚Äôm no different. When I was a web developer, I cringed whenever someone asked me to build a form. They‚Äôre tedious to make and took me away from other important projects.

I was too lazy to keep doing forms the hard way, and I knew there must be others out there who felt the same way. So I developed a tool making it easy for lazy people to make forms quickly.

Being a better manager

Your lazy employees are telling you something, even if they won‚Äôt say it.

Is your company‚Äôs mission, product, or service exciting them? Are their jobs boring? If your employees aren‚Äôt motivated in the office, it‚Äôs time to sit up and take note.

In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell says that autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort and reward are the three qualities for work to be satisfying.

If your employees aren‚Äôt regularly motivated in their jobs, find out if their work is worth doing for what they‚Äôre being paid, or if they need a bigger challenge. While I emphasis hiring great people at JotForm, I understand that there are two types of motivation: intrinsic and extrinsic. Some people will be more extrinsically motivated by things like money and praise. Others are intrinsically motivated by the sheer activity itself. So when identifying a lazy employee, seek to understand what is or isn‚Äôt motivating them.

Encouraged relaxation

Lazy people don‚Äôt exactly burn the midnight oil.

I have hard-working employees at JotForm, and I appreciate that. But I don‚Äôt want them working late. If I see them e-mailing or using Slack after 8 p.m., I‚Äôll nicely ask them to not work at those hours.

That‚Äôs because if they‚Äôre working late and stressing out about projects, then they aren‚Äôt sleeping well. And I‚Äôd rather have a focused, well-rested employee than one who‚Äôs up late answering petty emails.

Asking my employees to be idle actually benefits their productivity and the company‚Äôs bottom line.

Reduced busy-bragging

Busyness is a hamster wheel that everyone seems to brag about using.

But if you let yourself be lazy, then you don‚Äôt waste time working on random tasks just to avoid having nothing to do. Being busy for the sake of being busy is far worse than saving your effort for meaningful work.

Think about what matters most to you and your organization and work toward those goals. If it means you have periods of nothing to do, embrace it. Kick your feet up, stare out the window, and go for walks. You‚Äôll know when it‚Äôs time to do the important stuff.

Goal alignment

Listen to your lazy side. There‚Äôs no better time to check in with yourself about what you really need to be doing than when you‚Äôre slacking off.

As an entrepreneur, you‚Äôll likely be industrious when it comes to doing the things you need to do to succeed. If the work you‚Äôre doing is making you a sloth, then it could be a sign that you‚Äôre not doing what you need to do.

Let your laziness be a barometer that tells you if the work you‚Äôre doing is impactful or necessary to your goals.

Boosted creativity

Taskmasters on your team aren‚Äôt always the same ones who come up with the best ideas. In fact, creatives often need to be diligent about making sure they have time to do nothing at work so they can actually think. This is true for developers, designers, and writers.

When your day isn‚Äôt occupied by menial tasks, your mind can wander and creative thinking can take place. It still requires a person sets down their phone and doesn‚Äôt browse the internet. But just being away from work and not being distracted can be the best thing to come up with new ideas.

I force this a bit at JotForm by going on lengthy walks. Oftentimes I‚Äôll bring along an employee or two. It‚Äôs great because once you‚Äôve stepped out into the world and away from the minutiae of doing tasks, you can relax and come up with better ideas.

In the same way that we blame laziness for problems, we also unreasonably credit hard work to someone‚Äôs success. JotForm is successful in part because I was too lazy to build web forms the old fashioned way. Of course I worked hard when I needed to. But being lazy enabled me to be innovative and focus on making a difference.

If I‚Äôd worked tirelessly every moment of every day, I never would have had the opportunity to build a company that now employs 120 people and has a 4 million users around the world.

So if you find yourself being lazy, don‚Äôt fret it. It‚Äôs a sign that you‚Äôre human and can compartmentalize the work that‚Äôs important from the work that‚Äôs not.

This was an excellent article to read first thing this morning. I do want to start my own business and have a hard time with things like accounting and building a webpage and facebook page, and few other things. I didn‚Äôt blame it on laziness, I just don‚Äôt like accounting! I‚Äôve learned it is very intelligent to ask for others help who love paperwork‚Ä¶

I am going to show this article to my wife. I am all about changing the conversation about being lazy! I do think innovation comes from people who work smarter rather than working harder. Interesting topic. Interested in reading more comments from others.
